# What is PRIMM?

- **PRIMM** is a method for teaching programming concepts
- It stands for **Predict**, **Run**, **Investigate**, **Modify** and **Make**.
- The **PRIMM** technique can help you learn how to read and understand code before you start writing code

Here's how PRIMM helps you learn to code:

- **Predict**: Analyze a snippet of code and try to predict what the code will do before you run it
- **Run**: Run the code and try to predict what the code will do before you run it
- **Investigate**: Study parts of the code and understand how the different parts work together
- **Modify**: Make small changes to the code and see how the changes affect how the code runs
- **Make**: Apply what you've learned in the previous steps to create a new script

## Predict

- Text

```python
print('Hello!')
```

## Run

- Run the starter script and see what happens

## Investigate

- Step 1
- Step 2

## Modify

- Modify your script as follows:

```python
print('Good morning!')
```

## Make

- Using what you've learned in the previous steps, write a script that:
    - does X
    - does Y
