# What is PRIMM?

- **PRIMM** is a method for teaching programming 
- **PRIMM** stands for **Predict**, **Run**, **Investigate**, **Modify** and **Make**.
- The **PRIMM** technique helps you learn how to read and understand code before you start writing code

## Predict
*Analyze a snippet of code and try to predict what the code will do before you run it.*
- Text

```python
print('Hello!')
```

## Run
*Run the code and try to predict what the code will do before you run it.*
- Run the starter script and see what happens

## Investigate
*Study how the different parts of a script work together.*
- Step 1
- Step 2

## Modify
*Make small changes to your code and see how the changes affect how the code runs.*
- Modify your script as follows:

```python
print('Good morning!')
```

## Make
*Apply what you've learned in the previous steps to create a new script.*
- Using what you've learned in the previous steps, write a script that:
    - does X
    - does Y
